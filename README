cbench is a small helper library for doing benchmarking.

Here's some sample output:

cbench=> (cbench-pp 50 #(Thread/sleep 15))
-----------------------------------
| avg    | 15.22 ms
| min    | 15.0 ms
| max    | 19.0 ms
| stddev | 0.614119729717384 ms
| total  | 784 ms
-----------------------------------
nil

cbench provides 2 function, cbench and cbench-pp. More documentation to come.
